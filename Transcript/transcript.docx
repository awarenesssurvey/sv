don't be like me and don't see your
rejections as a measure of your
self-worth
because you're really selling yourself
short if you look at it that way
hi my name is leon i am a junior at
brown university
and today i'm going to be talking about
how i was accepted into the ivy league
and while i do admit that's been a while
since i applied to college
three years to be exact college
admissions has been a hot topic as of
late
with applicant race skyrocketing so i do
think
it would be helpful for me to give some
insight on this process
and my own experience and even though i
liked how everything turned out there
are still some things that i regret
doing
and i'll talk more about this later in
the video so keep watching till the end
so i'm going to break this down into
where i was accepted to
my statistics or stats my
extracurriculars
my awards my essays and then i'll finish
off with my regrets and my key most
important takeaways on this whole
process
so i'm going to keep this pretty general
not go into too much specifics but if
there's more demand for that then maybe
i'll make more videos
so let's start with where i was accepted
to so i applied to
16 schools and i was accepted to around
half of them
and out of those eight schools three of
them were considered top tier schools
and they were uc berkeley brown plme
which is a program
in now and cornell so i actually only
applied to
three out of all the ivys and i got into
brown and cornell
so i am two for three and then the
remaining schools were state schools in
new york
so like stony brook binghamton hofstra
which is actually private
but those types of schools anyways i
think the reason that i didn't apply to
so many top tier schools
was because i didn't think i would get
in and so i thought it was more safe to
go with
more state schools so i would have more
options my philosophy at the time was
that i would only apply to school
if i could see myself being there that
sounds a little bit vague but for
example i didn't apply to harvard
because i couldn't see myself
thriving in that type of environment so
now let's move on to stats
you know i always thought it was kind of
pointless after i was accepted
that year when people started asking me
oh what was your sat what was your gpa
and this is because i feel like people
should know now that a perfect sat score
or a perfect gpa does not guarantee
acceptance into
any top-tier school you know it comes
down to these metrics being
imperfect in the way the measurability
so for sats many schools are now sat
optional because people have realized
that this sort of standardized testing
creates inequality between
students who can afford advanced test
preparation versus students who cannot
and your score on a single exam tells
people very little about your
intelligence or where you'll end up in
the future
so if you consider this aspect then your
gpa is going to matter more because it's
a measure of your so-called achievement
for all four years of high school but
then you also have to consider that gpa
is calculated very differently between
high schools so for example my high
school calculated your gpa
out of a 100 scale that was also
weighted but many of my classmates at
brown
went to high schools with a letter
system so if you got above a 90
then you had an a a lower threshold is a
b very similar
to how brown does grades so if a high
school student from my high school were
to ask
another student at another high school
what their stats were given that they
were admitted to
an ivy league then you would be kind of
comparing
apples to oranges because one person
would have a letter grade and you're
comparing that to a numerical grade
that's also weighted i feel like in the
present day with this holistic
application process
as long as you are above the threshold
with the statistics
then you should be good and of course if
you're a special case such as an athlete
a legacy or
something else then maybe that threshold
will be slightly lower for you but
generally i would try to
just be above the average score so sat
gpa however that's calculated for the
school that you want to get
into of course that seems like obvious
advice but that was
kind of what i did and you know i try
not to worry too much about my scores
and try to focus more on other aspects
of the application that i thought were
more important i guess another stat is
uh ap classes
or ib classes so i was in the ap system
and i took around 12 aps which is kind
of a lot but i kind of just did it grind
it through my school offered a lot more
and i think it's really dependent on
what your school offers and if you take
advantage of that so yeah that's what i
tried to do now we're going to start
with extracurriculars i have to pull
this up since i kind of forgot what i
did in high school
so i did volunteering and shadowing at
the local hospital
i was a sports editor for my school's
newspaper club i did research with a
professor
and i submitted to several competitions
didn't really win anything but i'll talk
more about that later
and i was also on the science bowl team
and my main activity during high school
was running four years of track so
spring track winter track and cross
country i didn't do anything too special
like i didn't start my own non-profit
or my own company or anything i think
what kind of did set me apart was the
amount of time and effort i
put into running cross-country and track
and i knew in high school that i didn't
want to compete in college but i just
really loved doing that at the time if i
were to look back
i would never trade those years of
running for anything because being with
the team
during that time was such an
instrumental part of my high school
experience and really made me the person
that i am today and of course i wrote
about that in my college application
essays so i think my
main takeaway from this is that you
should do the things that you really
enjoy in high school
because it just doesn't make sense not
to and of course i'm lucky that it
worked out
but this is just my experience and take
what you want from me so now it's time
for the awards
so i have typed out on this word doc all
the awards that i remember
getting so i was a national
amerifinalist which meant i scored above
a
minimum on the psat i was a national ap
scholar which meant i
scored above four on a minimum number of
ap exams i had a bunch of regional
awards for
track and cross country that were kind
of minor i was
a presidential volunteer award recipient
for gold which meant i volunteered over
240 hours in a year
at the hospital and then i was an
explorer vision competition
semi-finalist kind of forget what it was
it was
kind of like a research uh
competition no not very impressive
compared to other people that i know
but i think it was sufficient in the end
and so now we're moving on to the last
part of the application
it is personal statements and essays i
want to stress that this is probably the
most
instrumental part of my application and
is arguably the reason why i was
admitted
not only into brown but also into the
plme program there
so basically i started writing my
supplements over
the summer before senior year and then i
slowly edited it every single day
i looked at it made a few tweaks here
and there and then i submitted
in december for rds i mostly wrote about
my high school experiences
writing in the newspaper running on the
track team and
of course about shadowing and
volunteering in the hospital which was
like a big part of the reason why i
wanted to become a doctor i haven't
really looked at my
admissions of this for a while but i
knew at the time that they were really
really good and i couldn't be more proud
of what i had written
over these six months maybe i'll share a
few
if you want me to share some of them
drop a comment down below
and maybe i'll make a video about it and
i want to emphasize again
that you know with holistic admissions
now
your scores are not going to matter as
much what matters more is the type of
person that you are
and if you can really convey what makes
you you and how you would contribute
to the school that you're applying to
you know and this makes sense because
to the admissions officers you're not
really a person until they read your
essays
you know you're just a set of numbers
set of scores and accomplishments
and so if you were to worry about
something in your applications process
don't worry about the few points on your
sat your gpa
worrying more about your essay and
really
coming up with a story that defines the
person that you are
so that was a quick and dirty overview
of what i remember about my application
three years ago and now we're on to the
final portion that you've been waiting
for which is the regrets that i have
given that i'm a junior now
it's been a bit since i applied to
college i think my main regret
is that i wish i didn't stress as much
at the time and
really place all this importance on
getting into a good school you know at
the time i would stress about it every
day and i would check
college confidential i'd read profiles i
would look at stats and all seems kind
of pointless
looking back on it now because i wasted
so much energy
into just stressing about it and it
wasn't helping at all at the time you
know i had this
false notion in my head that oh my
career would be somehow over if i only
got into a state school
which is definitely not the case and you
know early on in the application process
i was rejected from
many different programs and i started to
really fear that possibility
overall i think that time in high school
was just
really stressful and it wasn't very
enjoyable and i
wasn't very happy during my senior year
but then again i also want to say that i
don't regret putting all the work
into getting to where i am now you know
there's that saying where
if you like where you are now you
shouldn't have any regrets so you know i
don't regret all the hours i put in to
study
you know do extracurriculars i think all
those things kind of added up
and helped me to get where i am now you
know the truth is
college admissions is just a system it's
like a game that everyone has to play
and if you're someone like me who has
played the game
and has apparently won the game then you
can look back and say oh
this is kind of dumb you know what i did
here and maybe i shouldn't have done
that
but you know at the moment you didn't
really know how things would end up
so that was all you could do at the time
and i totally emphasized if you're
applying to colleges now that must be
how you feel
and you know that brings me on to my
next point and i really want to drive
this home and it's the fact that
the college admissions process like many
things in life has an element of luck
inside you know if you just look at the
bare bones logistics
every single year college admissions
officers have to comb
through thousands upon thousands of
college applications
and narrow down all these applicants
into
a 10 or less percent acceptance rate
you know really imagine the scene and
how things can play out
so let's look at a place like brown
right with a
around 7 acceptance rate so it's a
gloomy january
all the regular decision applicants have
submitted their applications and the
admissions officers are sitting in their
gloomy office it's raining outside
or possibly snowing it's a cloudy day
they're sipping their coffee going
through all these papers
and maybe your essay is about how you
love
the tv show friends so stay with me
right here
and it just so happens that the
admissions officer who's reading your
essay
really hates that show so because of
that they're not going to look
favorably on your application there's
many different idiosyncrasies that can
just match up
and so there's an element of luck it
depends on who you're matched to in
terms of the admissions officer it
depends on how they're feeling that day
you know what if one admissions officer
had just come back from a
great run around the city of providence
okay and they read
my college essay which was about how i
love running obviously they're going to
look favorably
upon my essay compared to an essay about
another topic
because of their inherent bias and
theoretically speaking these are all
potential scenarios that
could occur and maybe it would come down
to something like this
instead of whether you are a good
applicant for
brown university you know the thing with
holistic
applications is that there is very
little
objectivity on top of this there are
many other factors outside of your
control that contribute to acceptance
and this involves
legacy children or the children of
celebrities or the children of parents
who have a lot of money
who donate to the university and the
thing about the system of higher
education is that it tends to favor the
economically and socially elite so if
you look at a place like brown
university the median family income of a
brown student
is way higher than the median family
income of a typical person in the united
states
if you're from a lower social or
economic background it's possible that
your likelihood for admissions into an
ivy league will be lower than someone
else of equal ability
you know when i was applying to college
i really failed to realize just how
inherently unfair and luck based the
system is
so don't repeat my mistake if you're
planning to play
the college admissions game go into it
knowing that it is unfair
you might be at a disadvantage and that
the outcome does not determine the
person that you are
don't be like me and don't see your
rejections as a measure of your
self-worth because you're really selling
yourself short
if you look at it that way and so with
that i want to end on this note whenever
people ask me
after i got into brown university how i
got in
i always don't know how to respond
because i can tell you
exactly what i did and i just happened
to get in after doing that but i don't
know the formula for getting into brown
i only know
maybe there's a correlation between
something that i did and the
end result but i'm not sure if there is
a direct causation
i think i'm just very grateful and i'm
thankful to be able to attend such a
good school despite the fact that many
people might think that i got here
through my own effort somehow i know
that the difference between acceptance
and rejection could have been just a
meniscal detail
and so the title of this video is how i
got into the ivy league and my final
answer
to that question is i actually don't
know i don't know for sure
but this is what i did and this is my
advice that i have hopefully
you could come away from this video with
some insights and just not
stress too much about things that are
outside of your control
so if you watched this far first of all
thank you
and if you liked the video give it a
thumbs up below comment if you have any
questions regarding
anything i mentioned the video or the
applications process
and subscribe to my channel for more
content
well thanks for watching again and i'll
see you soon
peace
