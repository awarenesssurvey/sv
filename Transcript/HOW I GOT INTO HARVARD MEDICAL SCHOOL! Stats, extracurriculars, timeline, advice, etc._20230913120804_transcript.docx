what's up youtube peeps this is a video
talking about my medical school
application cycle i'll talk about where
i applied where i got in
what my stats and everything were i'll
try to give you everything that i got
and also what my essays were like and
then some other thoughts and advice
this is a whole
i want to preface this by saying the
reason why i chose to make a video like
this was to
provide information for folks who are
currently like i was when i was entering
the pre-med kind of cycle
i was
interested in content that you know
where folks would share uh what their
application was like where they got in
that kind of thing it was very helpful
for me to gauge
for example what kind of medical schools
i should be applying to in the first
place how competitive i was
that sort of thing
and just to get a sense of of what
applicants were like and and that sort
of thing so
let's jump right in
first where did i apply uh where did i
get in where did i get interviews that
kind of thing so i applied to 16 schools
originally in the primary applications
i'm not sure if i'll be clever enough to
put little animation text on
but you know apologize apologies if not
here we go
from the top ordered by preference i had
a whole spreadsheet which i recommend
i applied to let's see harvard ucsf
johns hopkins
penn columbia yale
stanford duke nyu pitt university of
washington ucla michigan
washu and st louis
mayo clinic university of chicago and
icon school of medicine
in mount sinai
great programs
and especially i was focused on
psychiatry
research and leadership those were my
kind of main three things and so i
focused on medical schools that i knew
had really strong programs in psychiatry
in research
and in leadership and kind of
interpersonal
work that sort of thing i'm particularly
focused in general on sort of community
type work i think going forward and so
these programs also were strong in those
fields
that's why i chose them so
moving on to where i did my secondary
application
i did a secondary and everywhere except
for uh university of chicago
sorry university of chicago
not that i know maybe they wouldn't have
wanted me anyway but
i had already received an acceptance by
then uh and so i didn't end up doing my
secondary my cycle was very much dragged
on i'll talk about the timeline in a
little bit
okay so what about interviews i ended up
getting rejected pre-interview from ucsf
duke ucla and michigan so i ended up
with interviews to all the others which
was very exciting
onto acceptances i ended up getting
acceptances
to harvard
to penn
yale
pitt
and washu
school of medicine so very very exciting
in terms of wait lists i ended up
getting wait listed at a hopkins
stanford nyu mayo clinic and icon in
mount sinai and the other ones were
rejections
so and in terms of where i'm ended up
i'll probably be headed to harvard
medical school in the fall which is
incredibly exciting a huge dream school
and something i'm thrilled
you know an incredible opportunity
in terms of stats and whatnot and the
rest of my the kind of meat of my
application
stats wise my gpa overall is
whenever i applied was a 3.94
again at unc chapel hill i'm not sure
about science versus non-science
but i don't think i lost points in
non-science so i think
most of those
gpa deductions were within science
classes
for my mcat score i ended up with a 523
very exciting i'll talk about how i
studied for that in just a second
my
other elements of my application in
terms of extracurriculars i had done a
few service projects some research and
some ems work as an emt in transport
now i'll run through all three of those
just real quickly in terms of service
projects i had started
joining some clubs and working with
other institute you know
organizations i ended up moving on to
starting my own kind of organizations
focused on things that i was really
particularly passionate about i ended up
starting an organization called the
teach initiative that's working on
mental health and substance use
education in north carolina high schools
and other kind of uh spaces that was
incredibly important to me for a variety
of reasons that i won't get into
but it you know something i was
passionate about i've also done some
work along the lines of cherokee
language revitalization another personal
passion project and something that
you know i've been excited about i want
to say for both of those
it's critical to point out that those
are the result of a ton of work by a ton
of people not just me i got massive
amount of support from other folks at
unc and elsewhere
so huge huge props to those folks
and i want to be clear none of that
would have been remotely possible if i
had been trying to do things by myself
so
maybe first tip team building is super
important um and uh of course you know
having folks around who are ready to
jump in and help is uh legendary so
that's that um and various other kind of
um smaller service projects but those
are the main two in terms of research i
have been working in a research lab at
unc uh since my first year there
i have kind of moved up and done some
more independent projects a lot of my
research especially work in cell culture
working with neurons and microglia has
been pretty dramatically unsuccessful
so i say that because if there are any
folks out there who are doing research
and the research hasn't been working out
trust me i've been there for years i
know the feeling so that's been the case
with a lot of my research i ended up
being able to pull some stuff together
and i finished my honors thesis recently
so i have
done the kind of research progression
but you should know that if research
isn't working out for whatever reason
you know
i've been there and i know the feeling
on i also was part of another research
project working on mental health
and substance use and what not in
unc students kind of a survey-based
project
as distinct from my kind of cell culture
animal behavior type work in the first
lab both of those are great and very
much exploratory i'll talk in a bit
about kind of exploring your passions
and again for that for both of those is
just things that i was personally
interested in
that's that now
last thing uh ems work and generally
exploring medicine i did a little bit of
shadowing not a ton i shadowed i think
maybe five-ish maybe 10-ish physicians
usually not for a long time just for
about a day for the most part or a
couple days
great experiences though i learned a lot
about medicine and learned a lot
especially about options of careers in
medicine
more importantly though i did a lot of
ems work i started as an emt around when
kovid hit that was my sophomore year i
had gotten pulled back from my study
abroad program
so i tried to become an emt
i was mostly entirely i've worked in
transport not in 911 type emergency
medical services
it's been an incredible experience for
me especially someone who's interested
in psychiatry and transport we're not
dealing with super emergent cases right
we're just kind of taking people from
place to place what that means is that
you have the opportunity to chat with
incredible folks all the time for hours
on end sometimes so that's been a
wonderful experience and something that
i highly recommend in terms of exploring
whether you really would enjoy medicine
those are some of my extracurriculars
in terms of my essays i wrote about a
lot of stuff mostly very personal stuff
i kind of got into why i'm interested in
medicine why i'm interested in
psychiatry in particular one of the main
points a lot of my essays was the idea
that i've spent time exploring and have
come to the conclusion based on evidence
that medicine is right for me which is
true i don't have any family that are
physicians or anything like that i
thought for a long time that i wanted to
go purely research and various other uh
options and whatnot i just have tried a
ton of stuff and eventually settled down
on yeah okay
clearly i have thoroughly enjoyed my
experiences in medicine they've kind of
clicked with my brain the way that other
things don't and so this is something
that i need to be doing in my career
that i think um i hope was compelling uh
the idea that you know i've kind of
tried different things and found yep
this is the thing
then also of course there's other sort
of personal thoughts i told a lot of
stories i tended to not try to just list
things because you do have the
opportunity to share all of your
extracurriculars and whatnot in the
application elsewhere so i tried to not
just list um but definitely you know i
told a lot of stories and gave a sense
of
tried to give a sense of the kind of
person that i wasn't why i was
interested that's that
now
those are
that's the essays the
stats the everything
last thing i want to share is a little
bit of
just some advice that i picked up during
the cycle that people told me that i
want to pass on to anyone watching my
youtube videos so uh first off
the timeline the advice that i received
is that applying
kind of in the middle of the cycle is
actually sometimes a good thing and that
applying early is not always super ideal
this is very controversial you'll hear
from almost all pre-med advisors and
what at least i did that you have to
apply as early as possible otherwise
your toast
it's not true
at least according to i talked to a
person affiliated with johns hopkins
admissions and he said that applying
early is not necessarily a great thing
why because you're compared against the
best of the vast the ideas of people who
are most on top of things who are ready
to rock are applying as soon as possible
but if you apply a little bit later on
you're compared more with folks who are
slightly less kind of put together i
don't know i was in that group so i you
know just took a while for me to kind of
get everything together so you're
compared against other folks who are
similarly a little bit behind you don't
want to apply dramatically late
just because things fill up
but you know whenever you apply um it's
not necessarily critical to get it super
early for my cycle i
did
the mcat a month after my junior year of
college ended
i'm currently a senior unc so i did my
mcat
or i did my yeah mcat in uh june
right i finished the semester on mayesh
did the thing in june got scores back
around july and submitted the primary
application then
and then i did my secondaries for a
while afterwards so that's my timeline
other thoughts that i have heard and
that i think are really important the
main one being that it's critical to
do things that interest you
right you want to do things that
interest you why because you want to be
able to speak to them
and be able to say why you did them you
want to be able to talk about them well
for example in research right you want
to do research that you personally find
exciting if you find it exciting you'll
explore as much as you can you'll read a
bunch of papers you'll get into it and
then once somebody asks you about it
you'll be able to share all kinds of
thoughts about that sort of thing about
your research about why you did what you
did etc same goes for ems same goes for
whatever
also i think it's critical to be aware
of what you're interested in to kind of
check in what am i interested in what do
i have time for is very important and
how can i
be doing the things i'm excited about at
the maximum of my capacity
a couple things there right kind of
three things number one again if you
find that what you're interested in
isn't medicine
okay there are a lot of lot of ways
fabulous ways to help people to get
involved to support folks etc i
considered a lot of these different
options and many of them are excellent
if you find that what you're
pulled to is not necessarily the pre-med
stuff cool you'll have i think a
wonderful career doing whatever those
things are or you know if you want to
pursue medicine obviously you know do so
but i think
be cognizant of what you're being pulled
to intrinsically
also there in terms of being most
efficient make sure you keep track of
the things you get yourself into i have
definitely over scheduled myself some of
that was good frankly early on i over
scheduled myself quite a lot i ended up
having kind of a terrible semester i
didn't sleep a lot it was awful that
said it set me up really well for having
things on my resume that i ended up
applying with and and getting in with
that said as time went on i wanted to
make sure that those things that i had
started during my super intense time i
wanted to make sure that i was doing
them to the most to the you know to my
kind of maximal capacity and so i
dropped back on a lot of things to make
sure that i could focus on the things
that i wanted to do and really do them
well that's really critical i hope you
all do that too make sure that whatever
you're doing you're doing it well the
last thing on that sleep please sleep
just do it it's really important
i will say this
i have rarely you know i know a lot of
folks
will say i can't sleep because i need to
do such and such
acutely i understand 100 there have been
many times not before tests but many
times when you need to do some kind of
project in my personal experience when
i've had to just you know you just gotta
pull an all-nighter and do some sort of
project i get it that sort of thing
happens from time to time chronically
losing sleep though makes you
inefficient i've done this so i know it
makes you inefficient and what that
inefficiency means is that you don't get
enough out of your time so whenever
you're really chronically sleep deprived
you're not getting your money's worth of
the time that you do have and so you end
up actually having less effective time
than you would have if you spent the
extra few hours sleeping and then we're
able to be really sharp during the
waking hours
that's important and something that i
hope you all do as well also of course
exercise keep taking care of yourself
etc all these things are really critical
i'm someone with adhd if you also have
adhd exercise can be very important keep
active
i find myself incredibly distractible
always but especially whenever i don't
exercise so that's also important
okay so that's all the thoughts i have
for you today um thank you so much for
watching my youtube video uh and i'm
excited for your journey uh good luck to
you
and and i'm sure you'll kill it and have
a great time
thanks bye
